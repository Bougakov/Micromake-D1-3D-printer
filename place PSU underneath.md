# Placing PSU underneath Micromake D1 printer to save space

This tweak was initally described in this artcile on http://3dtoday.ru/blogs/sanja/hide-the-power-supply-delta-printer-under-body/; here is an extended version.

The purpose of this mod is to make Micromake D1 "monolitic" - so it could be carried in one piece easily. Another goal is to improve the safety of the PSU, because mains voltage is otherwise dangerously exposed.

Here is the close-up. Pictured is the Orange PI PC computer that hosts Repetier Server and works as dedicated printer controller:

I've started by cutting the triangle from OSB plate 2cm thick. It is easier to work with compared to wood and plywood, and it is heavier, which is good for a base plate. Use a sheet of A3 paper to make a template, glue it to the wood and cut with the oscillating saw. Use sandpaper attachment to polish the edges, then wipe it clean with cloth. Paint with the cheapest black aerosol paint in 2 layers, let it dry properly. Apply soft furniture pads on the bottom to protect your desk from scratches.

Initially I used stock Micromake 16.5 amps PSU placed flat on the bottom, with the dedicated fan. But since the stock PSU turned to be garbage, I bought slightly larger 30A replacement PSU.

I have placed the new PSU on the left side, and used longer, 20cm M4 rods:
