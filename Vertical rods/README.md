# Vertical rods for Micromake printer

Micromake sells these, yet [they are too costly](http://ali.ski/IoA41). You can order copies from a local laser- or plasma-cutting service - ask for 2mm steel.

There are 3 versions:

 * for dtandard 682mm high printer
 * for shorter 650mm version
 * for [modified 682mm version with "basement" for PSU](https://github.com/Bougakov/Micromake-D1-3D-printer/blob/master/place%20PSU%20underneath.md)
